## Section 1: Data Pipelines

**Ensure that these libraries are installed in your Python configuration**

 - pandas (pip install pandas)
 - numpy (pip install numpy)
 - crontab (pip install crontab)

Run this in order (in terminal):

 1. `python cron.py` (to set-up the cron scheduler which will run daily)
 2. `python main.py` (run once to process dataset1 and dataset2 csv files)
